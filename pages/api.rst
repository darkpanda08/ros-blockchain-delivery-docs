About API
*********

* API has been made using go language and serves the purpose of connecting Blockchain with ebots in ROS.
* To make API available over internet we have used ngrok. Alternatively port forwarding can also be used.
* Rest API is used for both vaccine center and ebots to connect with Blockchain.
* Vaccine center used it to place an order.
* Ebots use it to identify the delivery to make in there respective areas.

To place order from Vaccine centers
************************************

.. code-block:: javascript

    placeorder = {
    "Orderby" : "hosf",
    "Warehouse" : "warehouse1",
    }
    r = requests.post('http://localhost:8081/createList', json=placeorder)
    print(r.json())

To check Order from ebots
**************************

.. code-block:: javascript

    name = {
    'botname':'bot3'
    }
    r = requests.post('http://localhost:8081/checkYourOrder', data=name)
    print(r.json())

To change the delivery status after completion
**********************************************

.. code-block:: javascript

    r = requests.post('http://localhost:8081/ordererCompleted', data={'orderid':'orderlist2'})
    print(r.json())

.. note::
    Backend URL used here is ``http://localhost:8081`` replace it with URL of your server.

Challanges faced
****************

* One of the biggest problems with building the blockchain based rest api was we didnâ€™t have any sources to learn so we had to experiment everything and had to build everything from scratch.

..
    * Other issues with it was we needed to access it again and again which increases the transaction time to over come that we had to convert it into a global variable so the files were only access only when it was required.

* We had to pass everything in string format and even decode the incoming data in string irrespective of the defined data structure in the blockchain.
