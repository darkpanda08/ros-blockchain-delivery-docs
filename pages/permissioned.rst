Permissioned Blockchain
########################
The two types of blockchain network are Permissioned and Premissionless blockchain network.

What are the Permissioned Blockchains?
**************************************
Permissioned blockchains are blockchain networks that require access to be part of. In these blockchain types, a control layer runs on top of the blockchain that governs the actions performed by the allowed participants known as MSP (Membership Service Provider)

So, basically, there is one big difference between a permissioned and a premissionless one, i.e., the way the participants are going to interact with the network. A permissioned system is also known to have a restriction on the consensus participants, making permissioned networks highly configured and controlled by the owners. However, it is not a bad thing, but it is all about building a suitable blockchain network.

There are many popular permissioned blockchain frameworks out there. It includes Hyperledger, Quorum, Corda, and others.

Permissioned vs Permissionless Blockchains
******************************************
In a permissionless blockchain, virtually anyone can participate, and every participant is anonymous. In such a context, there can be no trust other than that the state of the blockchain, prior to a certain depth, is immutable. In order to mitigate this absence of trust, permissionless blockchains typically employ a “mined” native cryptocurrency or transaction fees to provide economic incentive to offset the extraordinary costs of participating in a form of byzantine fault tolerant consensus based on “proof of work” (PoW).

Permissioned blockchains, on the other hand, operate a blockchain amongst a set of known, identified and often vetted participants operating under a governance model that yields a certain degree of trust. A permissioned blockchain provides a way to secure the interactions among a group of entities that have a common goal but which may not fully trust each other. By relying on the identities of the participants, a permissioned blockchain can use more traditional crash fault tolerant (CFT) or byzantine fault tolerant (BFT) consensus protocols that do not require costly mining.

Benefits of Permissioned Blockchains
************************************
There are many benefits of permissioned blockchains which makes it most preferable to use when compared with the permissionless blockchains. Let’s understand the beneficial features of permissioned blockchains with its benefits.

* **Efficient performance:** When we compared permissioned blockchains to permissionless blockchains, they offer better performance. The core reason behind this is the limited number of nodes on the platform. This removes the unnecessary computations required to reach consensus on the network, improving the overall performance. On top of that, permissioned networks have their own pre-determined nodes for validating a transaction.

* **Proper governance structure:** Permissioned networks do come with an appropriate structure of governance. This means that they are organized. Administrators also require less time to update the rules over the network, which is considerably faster when compared to public blockchains. The public blockchain network suffers from the consensus problem as not all nodes work together to get the new update implemented. These nodes might place their self-interest above the needs of the blockchain, which, in return, means slower updates to the whole network. In comparison, permissioned blockchain doesn’t have the problem, as the nodes work together to move the updates faster.
* **Decentralized storage:** Permissioned networks also make proper use of blockchain, including utilizing its decentralized nature for data storage.
* **Cost-Effective:** There is no doubt that permissioned blockchains are more cost-effective when compared with the permissionless blockchains.
